As of 3:00pm on Monday, April 6th Wisconsin has reported 2,440 positive
diagnoses of COVID-19. Of these, 1,860 (or 76%) are in the 5 hardest-hit
counties: Milwaukee, Dane, Waukesha, Kenosha, and Ozaukee. Each county
except Kenosha has seen itâ€™s share of the absentee-ballot electorate
fall from the 2019 Spring election to the 2020 Spring election.

**Collectively, the share of absentee ballots returned in these 5
counties has declined 7%, from 51.3% of statewide ballots in 2019 to
44.3% in 2020.**
