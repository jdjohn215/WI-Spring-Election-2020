Do absentee ballot returns look more or less like the general
electorate?
================

As of 3:00pm on Monday, April 6th Wisconsin has reported 2,440 positive
diagnoses of COVID-19. Of these, 1,860 (or 76%) are in the 5 hardest-hit
counties: Milwaukee, Dane, Waukesha, Kenosha, and Ozaukee. Each county
except Kenosha has seen its share of the absentee-ballot electorate fall
from the 2019 Spring election to the 2020 Spring election.

**Collectively, the share of absentee ballots returned in these 5
counties has declined 7%, from 51.3% of statewide ballots in 2019 to
44.3% in 2020.**

The question is, to what extent will these absentee ballot numbers
mirror the final electorate?

In 2019 only a small amount of voters used the absentee process, and
they were not evenly distributed across the counties. The five counties
mentioned above only made up 38.8% of the total Spring 2019 electorate
when it was all said and done. If the absentee ballots cast thus far in
2020 actually make up a preponderance of the electorate (as they likely
will), then the situation looks much different, with **the 5 counties
described above potentially making up 5.5% *more* of the electorate than
in 2019**.

(See the code in this repo for how these stats were calculated.)
